                Online therapy is therapy done remotely through a video conferencing platform, chat room, email, or over the phone. 
                It has sparked in popularity ever since the COVID-19 pandemic forced therapists to expand their offerings in order to keep everyone safe.
                <br/>
                If youâ€™re worried about the quality of your session, research shows that online therapy can be just as effective as therapy done in person.
                 Many people prefer online therapy because it offers more privacy, can be more accessible, and is often cheaper.
                 We considered many criteria when selecting the best online therapy platforms, including:
                <ul> all mental health professionals are licensed psychotherapists, psychologists, or psychiatrists</ul>
                <ul>a simple sign-up process</ul> 
                <ul>positive customer feedback</ul>
            <ul>flexible payment options and fees</ul>
        <ul> a range of subscription options and services</ul>
                 <ul>some accepted insurance</ul>
                 therapists had a wide range of expertise, including anxiety, depression, trauma, relationship issues, substance misuse, grief, and eating disorders
